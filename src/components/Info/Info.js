                    <h4>Script:</h4> 

                    <p>Script changes are not permitted once they are approved by Merrill Lynch.  While you will not need to memorize your script, please be sure to practice your script as much as possible before the shoot date.  We will have a copy of your script ready to go in our teleprompter when you arrive.  It is not required that you bring hard copies of the script but you may choose to do so.</p>

                    <h4>Preparation:</h4>
                    <p>We ask that you practice your script out-loud in front of the mirror or on a recording prior to filming so that you feel confident and prepared when on camera. You are also always welcome to contact our studio using the form below or at 412-404-2868 to schedule a 15 minute consultation.</p>

                    <h4>What to wear:</h4>

                    <p>Please wear a business professional outfit that suits your personality. You will be filmed against a white backdrop so avoid white or very light colored clothing. If you wear glasses, we recommend that you wear contacts or bring glasses with non-reflective lenses to avoid glare from the video lighting.</p>

Once you get your best take, you will be asked to review, approve and sign off on which take you prefer the best. Refunds will not be issued after that point.  It is important that you sign off only if you are sure you will approve the video as re-shoot fees can be as costly as $8,000 depending on your location.</p>
